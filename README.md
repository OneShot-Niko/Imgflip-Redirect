# Imgflip Redirect
[![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OneShot-Niko/Imgflip-Redirect?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white&label=GitHub&color=181717)](https://github.com/OneShot-Niko/Imgflip-Redirect/releases)<br>
Currently I'm too bad at code so this extension doesn't appear to work all that well besides when I try on LibreWolf. Guessing it's a conflict with another extension.
<br>Anyways, this is a test extension simply because I wanted to make one, if I ever get better at coding, I may try making this extension just revert any new UI change because of how nostalgic and wellmade the original UI felt, which is now stripped behind a singular annoying click lol.
<br>I'd publish to Mozilla Addons (I do not use Chrome whatsoever) however I'm a bit too lazy, so have at it.

## Installation (via Zipball)
Firstly, click the ![code](https://github.com/OneShot-Niko/Imgflip-Redirect/assets/150537842/e9f4e3c5-fe11-464e-9b36-4fd7e96184cc) icon.<br>
Next, click ![download zip](https://github.com/OneShot-Niko/Imgflip-Redirect/assets/150537842/51aea15c-c89b-46da-be53-51e3eef0f38f).
<br>
After you finish downloading the zipball, extract it.
## Loading (Firefox)
Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` or simply `about:debugging` and click "This Firefox" (please excuse it being in Hungarian here)
![ff](https://github.com/OneShot-Niko/Imgflip-Redirect/assets/150537842/abbd98b4-3694-4754-a7ea-fceb8f2bbbf3)<br>
Afterwards, click "Load Temporary Addon".<br>
Now, go into the folder you extracted the zip to, then find & load the `manifest.json`. Nothing is needed to be changed.
> [!Warning]
> "Load Temporary Addon" isn't any image flip, that's ***serious***. Serious enough that it warrants a `comic-sans-ms` meme.<br>
> Please note that I am also unable to load the extension on Firefox no matter how hard I try, but it works on LibreWolf. No idea what causes this issue even if all other extensions are disabled, but if you are also encountering this, open an issue. Note that I'm probably gonna be failing to resolve it as I'm just bad at JS and again mybearworld basically carried the entire thing when I was screwing with the `manifest.json`


## Loading (Chrome/Chromium)
Note that this may vary. For chrome users, the place you want to go to is `chrome://extensions`, whilst for example Vivaldi users need `vivaldi://extensions`. Please keep in mind since I do not use Chrome (instead I use Vivaldi for tests) I will be using Vivaldi for this.<br>
You want to go to your extensions (`chrome://extensions/`, in my case that's `vivaldi://extensions/`.)<br>
Enable Developer Mode and then click load unpacked, then select the folder and you have loaded the extension.
> [!Note]
>
> I reccomend doing it with Chromium-based browsers if it's too monotonous to reload the extension each time. I'm too lazy to publish to Mozilla Addons, however if I ever do I promise I will include a link to it as soon as possible.
